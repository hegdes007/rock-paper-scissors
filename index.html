                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>“Rock paper scissors” is a hand game played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of the three shapes with an outstretched hand. Many of us used to play it in schools to resolve disputes or just to spend some time. Still you want to play the game but your friends are not with you at this moment? Don't worry at all. This site allows you to play with your computer at any time you want.
